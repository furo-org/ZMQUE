Build steps:
1) Build libzmq via cmake. This does an out of source build and installs the build files
	download and unzip the lib, cd to directory
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	sudo make -j4 install

2) Build cppzmq via cmake. This does an out of source build and installs the build files
	download and unzip the lib, cd to directory
	mkdir build
	cd build
	cmake ..
	sudo make -j4 install

Using this:

A cmake find package scripts is provided for you to easily include this library.
Add these lines in your CMakeLists.txt to include the headers and library files of
cpp zmq (which will also include libzmq for you).

#find cppzmq wrapper, installed by make of cppzmq
find_package(cppzmq)
if(cppzmq_FOUND)
    include_directories(${cppzmq_INCLUDE_DIR})
    target_link_libraries(*Your Project Name* ${cppzmq_LIBRARY})
endif()
